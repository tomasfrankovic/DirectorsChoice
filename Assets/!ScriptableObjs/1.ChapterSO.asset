    paragraphText: \n\tThe room they're in is very familiar to them, yet they feel
      as if something was off. As all the houses were built by the creators, each
      room's construction was aided by the Umbral Brigade. This specific room was
      created by Umbral Brigade no. 41 which was known to put extra keys inside {metal
      safes} for emergencies. Also provided as a standard issue for most bedrooms,
      is a a comfortable {sofa} along with a television set, only to be used for
      pre-recorded shows, as no signal is ever provided.
