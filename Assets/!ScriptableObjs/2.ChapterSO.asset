    paragraphText: \n\tThe {cold} hallways of Komplex 74 were one of the more recent
      miracles invented by The Creators. The walls are reinforced to be especially
      durable to prevent entities from entering or leaving the premises in the case
      of a 3rd-degree E.Y.E. event. A notable feature of these hallways is the network
      of {plumbing} that litter the hallway. Because of the faculty density, no {windows}
      were selected to be added to hallways.
